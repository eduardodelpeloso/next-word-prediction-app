# next-word-prediction-app

This is a simple interactive NLP web app that predicts the next word a user will write after writing the first words of a sentence.
It employs the [Stupid Back-off Smoothing algorithm](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D07-1090.pdf). The app was written in R using Shiny and published at shinyapps.io [here](https://eduardodelpeloso.shinyapps.io/WordPredict/) and a small presentation describing the app, written in R Markdown, is available at RPubs [here](https://rpubs.com/eduardodelpeloso/213835).
